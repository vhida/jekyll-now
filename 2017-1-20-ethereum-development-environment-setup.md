Here's a brief environment setup how-to for Ethereum development. It's based on Mac OS.

1. Install Python2.7 <br>
2. Install solc, the solidity compiler, and solc-cli.<br>
    `'sudo npm install -g solc solc-cli --save-dev'`
    <br>
3. Install ethereum/cpp-ethereum, via brew.<br>
    `'brew tap ethereum/ethereum'`
    `'brew install ethereum'` 
    <br>
4. Install testrpc (to deploy smart contract as local test environment) via pip.<br>
    `'pip install eth-testrpc'`
    <br>
5. Install Node.js<br>
6. Install truffle(for fast local compiling and deploying smart contracts).<br>
    `'npm install -g truffle'`
    
When setting up the environment, network issue may cause various problems. Make sure every step is executed successfully, other wise roll back and re-do it.
