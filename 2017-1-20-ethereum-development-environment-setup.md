Here's a brief environment setup how-to for Ethereum development. It's based on Mac OS.

1. Install Python2.7.

2. Install solc, the solidity compiler, and solc-cli.

  `'sudo npm install -g solc solc-cli --save-dev'`

3. Install ethereum/cpp-ethereum, via brew.

  `'brew tap ethereum/ethereum'`
  `'brew install ethereum'` 

4. Install testrpc (to deploy smart contract as local test environment) via pip.

  `'pip install eth-testrpc'`

5. Install Node.js

6. Install truffle(for fast local compiling and deploying smart contracts).

  `'npm install -g truffle'`

When setting up the environment, network issue may cause various problems. Make sure every step is executed successfully, other wise roll back and re-do it.
